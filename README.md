Your website visitor will be able to share your blog post URL with their facebook friends. There will be a "Share" button at the bottom of you blog post, the visitor just have to click that and a window will pop-up with the blog post URL filled in the status field. Now, the visitor just has to click "Post" and your post is shared with the visitor's Facebook friends. The visitor need not be logged-in to use this feature. The "Share" button also displays the number of times post has been shared.

== Installation ==

The Customize Share for Facebook plugin can be installed in 4 easy steps:

1. Unzip "share-blog-with-social-network" archive and put all files into a folder like "/wp-content/plugins/share-blog-post-with-social-network/"
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in Admin dashboard
3. Look for "Share blog post with social network" in the settings menu, to confirm installation

== Known Issues ==

Position of the "Share" button can be done according to your liking by changing the "style.css" file in the WordPress editor. For example, add the the following code to "style.css", and change left padding to your liking.

.fb-share-button {
    padding-left: 700px;
}

Like that you can change other CSS values to position the button according to your liking. This happens because sometimes I have to work around the WordPress core, and modifying the theme may not be the ideal solution. It works, I have tested it many times from my end, but if any problems arise I am available for support.
